# Medical image processing - Final project

This project aims to implement a deep-learning model for automatic multi-landmark localization in medical images.

This project was implemented using the Python language and the numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy, pandas and tensorflow libraries.

## Architecture
- data/ : All data 
- doc/ : Presentation slides, inspired paper from the previous presentation and my own paper
- src/ : Functions in ipynb files and pre-trained model

## Requirements
- Reminder to change path to data if you try with another dataset
- Check the bloc of code / function before calling it.

## Fonctionnalities
- Multi-landmarks detection
- Change hyper-parameters as you need

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have an active internet connection to install external libraries.

3. Run the following commands if some of the libraries are not installed on your machine (prerequisite: Python) :

    ```pip install numpy```

    ```pip install matplotlib```

    ```pip install scipy```

    ```pip install pandas```

    ```pip install tensorflow```

4. Run all functions or just the ones you need to try.
