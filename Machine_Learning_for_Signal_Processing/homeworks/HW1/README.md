# Machine Learning for Signal Processing - Homework 1

This project was implemented using the Python language and the numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn and torch libraries. 

## Requirements
In this assignment, we will investigate:

- The concept of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
- The relation between NMF and Auto Encoder (AE).

## Architecture
- doc folder : Requirements and report
- src : code

## Fonctionnalities
- NMF : Choose the number of iterations and the number of latent components in the plot section (file : NMF.ipynb)
- EA : Choose the number of epochs (file : AE.ipynb)

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have an active internet connection to install external libraries.

3. Run the following commands if some of the libraries are not installed on your machine (prerequisite: Python) :

    ```pip install numpy```

    ```pip install matplotlib```

    ```pip install torch```

    ```pip install scikit-learn```

    ```pip install tqdm```

4. Run all functions.
