# Machine Learning for Signal Processing - Homework 3

This project was implemented using the Python language and the numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn libraries, torch, tensorflow, keras and opencv. This code is already on internet. The goal of this homework is to fill some parts to understand the concept of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM).

## Requirements
In this assignment, we will investigate:

- The concept of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
- The concept of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM).

## Architecture
- doc folder : Requirements and report
- src : code
