# Machine Learning for Signal Processing - Homework 2

This project was implemented using the Python language and the numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and sklearn libraries. This code is already on internet. The goal of this homework is to fill some parts to understand the concept of Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

## Requirements
In this assignment, we will investigate:

- The concept of Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP).
- The concept of t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

## Architecture
- doc folder : Requirements and report
- src : code

## Fonctionnalities
- ISOMAP : Choose the number of neighbors in the Nearest Neighbor Search section
- t-SNE : Choose the number of iterations, plot, the value of learning_plot, perplexe and momentum

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have an active internet connection to install external libraries.

3. Run the following commands if some of the libraries are not installed on your machine (prerequisite: Python) :

    ```pip install numpy```

    ```pip install matplotlib```

    ```pip install scikit-learn```

    ```pip install tqdm```

4. Run all functions.
