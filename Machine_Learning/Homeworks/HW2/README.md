# Machine Learning - Homework 2

This project aims to create a Naive Bayes classifier for each handwritten digit that support discrete and continuous and also use online learning to learn the beta distribution of the parameter p (chance to see 1) of the coin tossing trails in batch.

This project was implemented using the Python language and the numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, gzip, display, pillow, scipy libraries.
