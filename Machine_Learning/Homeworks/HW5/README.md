# Machine Learning - Homework 5

This project aims to implement a gaussian process regression to predict a distribution and also use a SVM model to tackle classification on images of hand-critten digits (MNIST).

This project was implemented using the Python language and the numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy and libsvm libraries.

## Architecture
- data folder : data and csv files
- doc folder : Requirements and report
- src : code
