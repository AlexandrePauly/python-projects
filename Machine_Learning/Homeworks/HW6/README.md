# Machine Learning - Homework 6

This project aims to code out kernel k-means and spectral clustering (both normalize cut and ratio cut) on images dont classify pixels.

This project was implemented using the Python language and the numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, Pillow and scipy libraries.

## Architecture
- data folder : Images/dataset
- doc folder : Requirements and report
- src : code and results for each clustering methods (a folder for each method and each image)

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have an active internet connection to install external libraries.

3. Run the following commands if some of the libraries are not installed on your machine (prerequisite: Python) :

    ```pip install numpy```

    ```pip install matplotlib```

    ```pip install pillow```

    ```pip install scipy```

4. Go in the src directory and launch the application : ```python3 main.py```
